🌫️ AQI Data Analysis & Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using publicly available datasets from data.gov.in. The main goal is to gain insights into pollution trends and predict AQI levels using statistical and machine learning models.

📂 Dataset
Source: data.gov.in

Type: CSV file(s) containing historical AQI data from multiple locations across India.

Features: Includes Date, City, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and AQI values.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML models for prediction

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

📊 Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Data type conversions

Feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing pollutant levels over time

Correlation analysis between pollutants and AQI

Seasonal and city-wise trends

Modeling

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Training regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.

Model evaluation using R² score, RMSE, and MAE

Prediction

Forecasting AQI values

Testing on unseen data

📈 Results
Identified major pollutants contributing to AQI spikes

Built models that predict AQI with reasonable accuracy

Discovered seasonal trends and city-wise pollution behavior

📌 Future Work
Integrate real-time AQI data using APIs

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit

Use Deep Learning models for more accurate predictions
